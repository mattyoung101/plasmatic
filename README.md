# Plasmatic
**UQCS Hackathon 2025**

by Matt Young

as Team "The Opps Took My Protected Mode Addressing, Can't Have Nothing in St Lucia"

## Goal
The goal is to make a plasma demo for MS-DOS (technically FreeDOS) in 2.5 days.

If that works out, I'm also going to try write a software renderer and spin some text around.
